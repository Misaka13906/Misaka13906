### Hi there 👋 I'm Misaka13906 or 东方延绪 on other social platforms

- 👧 I'm currently a sophomore majoring in Software Engineering at Nanchang University.
- 🤝 I'm working as a backend developer and collaborating with my friends in [NCUHOME](https://github.com/ncuhome).
- 💻 I mainly use Golang and Mysql in backend projects, and use C++ to solve algorithm problems (actually C with STL, haha), while I only had a little explosure to some other languages such as JavaScript, Java, and Python.
- 🎈 **Actually** the part I'm most familiar with in the field of computer is traditional algorithm, while for other parts, I **still need to enhance my learning**.
- 🌱 I'm currently starting to learn fundamentals of computer like computer network.
- 🔭 I'm also trying to explore some unfamiliar areas in the field of computer in order to discover which other areas I will be interested in.
